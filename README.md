A web-ish crawler to find the hardest problem on project euler

## Update 1
I am having trouble actually accesing the source code of the project euler site, SSL issue...Trying to find some gems

## Update 2
Python is working much better, using urllib and beatiful soup, got the HTML and it is ealisy parseable
