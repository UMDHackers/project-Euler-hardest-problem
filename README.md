# project-Euler-hardest-problem
A web-ish crawler to find the hardest problem on project euler

## Update 1
I am having trouble actually accesing the source code of the project euler site, SSL issue...Trying to find some gems

## Update 2
Python is working much better, using urllib and beatiful soup, got the HTML and it is ealisy parseable

## Update 3
Starting problem class, might be done with this in a few more days!

##Update 4
Ok now I have sorted based on the diffculty but there is a tie! So I am going to add a check to the solved by number to being the tie breaker
